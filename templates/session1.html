        <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
        <p>
            The Ministry of Education (MoE), Government of India (GoI) has established the National Testing Agency (NTA) as an
            independent, autonomous, and self-sustained premier testing organization under the Societies Registration Act (1860)
            for conducting efficient, transparent, and international standardized tests in order to assess the competency of
            candidates for admission to premier higher education institutions with a mission to improve equity and quality in
            education by developing and administering research-based valid, reliable, efficient, transparent, fair and international
            level assessments.
        </p>
        <p>
            NTA has created a system that is promoting teaching (by teachers), learning (by students), and assessment (by parents and institutions).
            NTA strongly believes in the quality, efficiency, effectiveness, equity, and security of assessments. To practice these values, NTA is
            constantly engaging with its stakeholders, viz. students, parents, teachers, experts, and partner institutions.
